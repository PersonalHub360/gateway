# Dependency Fix Guide

## Issue Resolved âœ…

The `qrcode.js@^0.0.2` dependency issue has been fixed. The problematic package has been replaced with the correct `qrcode@^1.5.3` package.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Replaced problematic dependency**: Changed `qrcode.js@^0.0.2` to `qrcode@^1.5.3` in `client/package.json`
2. **Updated installation script**: Added cleanup steps to remove conflicting lock files
3. **ESLint warnings**: The warnings about ESLint 8.57.1 are normal and don't affect functionality <mcreference link="https://eslint.org/version-support" index="0">0</mcreference>

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Batch File
```bash
# Run the updated installation script
install-dependencies.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd "c:\Users\mozam\Downloads\trea gateway file"

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Clean previous installations (if any issues)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Go back to root
cd ..
```

### Option 3: Using Yarn (Alternative)
```bash
# If you prefer yarn (already installed)
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
```

## Warnings Explained

The warnings you see during installation are normal and don't prevent the application from running:

- **ESLint 8.57.1**: This version is no longer supported but still functional
- **Deprecated packages**: These are dependencies of react-scripts and don't affect your app
- **Babel plugins**: These have been merged into ECMAScript standard but still work

## Verification

After installation, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check if dependencies are installed
ls client/node_modules

# Start the application
start-servers.bat
```

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Clear npm cache**:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Delete and reinstall**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Use different Node version**: Ensure you're using Node.js 16+ but not the very latest (some packages may not be compatible with Node 20+)

## Next Steps

1. Run `install-dependencies.bat`
2. Run `start-servers.bat`
3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

The dependency issue is now resolved and the application should install and run successfully!
